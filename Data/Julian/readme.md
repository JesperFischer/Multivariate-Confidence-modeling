# The effect of report order on metacognition.

Task decisions and confidence ratings are fundamental measures in metacognition research but using these reports requires collecting them in some order. Here, we test the effect of report order across popular domains of metacognition and probe two factors that may underlie why order effects have been observed in past studies; report time, and motor preparation.
