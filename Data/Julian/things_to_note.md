They have 2 stimulus intensities for each modality of investigation they used a threshold of ~70% correctness.

I.e.

Testing
A testing phase comprising 100 trials was used to assess metacognitive ability for the assigned report order and context. 
These trials were the only ones used to contrast metacognition between conditions. 
Stimulus properties were those selected by the experimenter in the calibration phase. 
Thus, the stimulus properties remained fixed for all trials at the participantâ€™s 70.71% accuracy threshold.



This is kinda annoying and bad as it does not allow for a full investigation of confidence and task dificulty .
