Subjects
A total of 51 subjects completed this study in a lab-based environment. 

Stimulus
Subjects completed a 2-choice orientation discrimination task (left- vs right-tilted Gabor patch). In the Stimulus column in the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates Gabor patch orientation, where 1 = left-tilted and 2 = right-tilted.

Response
In the Response column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates the decision made by the subject with regards to Gabor patch orientation, where 1 = left-tilted and 2 = right-tilted.

Confidence
A confidence rating using a discrete 4-point scale was used.

Manipulations
Either the left or the right hand was cued on each trial. Both response and confidence were given with the cued hand. 

Contrast
Stimuli were presented in 2 contrast levels. In the Contrast column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates low or high contrast, where 1 = low and 2 = high.

Condition
On each trial, subjects were prompted to respond with either the left or the right hand. Both decisions (response and confidence) were given with the cued hand. In the Condition column of the .csv file, hands are coded as 'left hand' and 'right hand'. 

Accuracy
A column indicating whether the response matched the stimulus, where 1 = correct and 0 = incorrect.

Response device
Experiment 1: Subjects used a keyboard.
Experiment 2: Subjects used a keyboard and a mouse, where keyboard responses were always left-handed and mouse responses were always right-handed.

Training
The training phase consisted of three blocks in total. The first block consisted of 20 trials where the Gabor contrast was fixed to 0.4. The other two training blocks consisted of 15 trials each with Gabor contrast set to 0.18 and 0.14, respectively. Decreasing contrast at this rate made the task harder with each training block. During the training session, subjects were given trial-by-trial feedback about the accuracy of their response. The training blocks were followed by two 100 staircase blocks used to estimate the optimal contrast level for each subject. The first staircase block was a 2-down-1-up with a step size of .01 and a total of 14 reversals. The second staircase was a 3-down-1-up and had the same parameters. The two contrast levels in the actual experiment (low vs. high) were set separately for each subject by either dividing the mean value across the two staircases by 1.2 (resulting in a low contrast value) or multiplying it by 1.2 105 (resulting in a high contrast value). The average values of the low and high contrasts were 8.1% (SD = 0.09) and 11% (SD = 0.09) for Experiment 1, and 5.8% (SD = 0.01) and 8.4% (SD = 0.01) for Experiment 2, respectively.

Experiment goal
Experiment 1: We were interested in whether hand dominance modulated the positive autocorrelation in confidence judgments known as "confidence leak".
Experiment 2: We were interested in whether motor effort (e.g., key press vs mouse) modulated the positive autocorrelation in confidence judgments known as "confidence leak".
