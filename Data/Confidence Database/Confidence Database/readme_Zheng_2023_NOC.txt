In one task, subjects reported Type-2 confidence ratings in 4-point scale; In the other task, subjects report Type-2 confidence in 2-point scale followed by an additional 2-point scale Type-3 rating on their certainty in the confidence rating.*  Group: 1 (started the Type-2/3 task first then the Type-2 only task), 2 (started the Type-2 only task first, then the Type-2/3 task).* Condition: 0 (Type-2/3 task, where Type-2 confidence rating and Type-3 confidence certainty rating are in 2-point scale); 1 (Type-2 only task, where Type-2 confidence rating is in 4-point scale, and Type-3 rating and rt were coded as -1 as there was no Type-3 rating in this task). * Block size: 40 trials per block, 10 blocks in total for each Type-2/3 and Type-2 only tasks.* Stimulus: 0 (left side of square contains more dots),  1(right side of square contains more dots)* Response: 0 (reported the left square), or 1 (reported the right square)* Accuracy: 0 (decision is not correct), or 1 (decision is correct)* RT_dec: response time in ms for the perceptual decision* Confidence:  In the Type-2/3 task, confidence was reported in a binary scale. 1 (low confidence) or 2 (high confidence). In the Type-2-only task, confidence was reported in a 4-point scale, 1 (very low), 2 (low), 3 (high), and 4 (very high). * RT_conf: response time in ms for the confidence (-1 when no confidence reported)* tyep3: Type-3 confidence certainty was reported in a 2-point scale. 1 (low certainty in the confidence rating) and 2 (high certainty in the confidence rating). -1 when no Type-3 rating was reported in the Type-2-only task* type3_rt: response time in ms for the Type3 confidence certainty (-1 when no Type3 rating reported)* Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was not provided.
