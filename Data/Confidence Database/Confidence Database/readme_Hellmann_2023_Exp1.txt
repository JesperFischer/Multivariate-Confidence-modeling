Experimental task: 
Participants saw a sinusoidal grid with a post mask and should decide whether the grid was oriented horizontally or vertically. Stimulus-onset asynchrony was manipulated on 5 levels. Decision and confidence were reported simultaneously using a joystick.

Information about included variables:
Stimulus: 1 (vertical) or 2 (horizontal), representing the orientation of the target
Response: 1 (vertical) or 2 (horizontal)
Confidence: Reported on visual analogue scales with poles ("unsure" and "sure"), values between -1(=unsure) and 1 (=sure)
RT_decConf: Response time for both decision and confidence report (given simultaneously)
SOA (manipulation): time between stimulus and mask onset in milliseconds. 
Training: Column indicating whether the trial was from the training block


Additional information: 
Sessions and Block size: Subjects completed 3 sessions, each with one training and 9 experimental blocks. Each block contained 60 trials.
Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was given as Error-Feedback (showing the word "Error" vor 1sec only after incorrect trials).
Response device: Joystick (Cyborg V1)
Experimental setting: Lab, darkened room
Instructions: Participants were asked to respond as accurately as possible (including their confidence).
Date and location: Data were collected at the Lab of the General Psychology II department of the KU Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt between November 2017 and January 2018.
