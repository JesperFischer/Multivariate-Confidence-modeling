Experimental task: 
Participants saw a random dot kinematogram with either upwards or downwards target direction. Motion coherence was manipulated on 5 levels. Decision and confidence were reported simultaneously using a joystick.

Information about included variables:
Stimulus: 1 (upwards) or 2 (downwards), representing the target motion direction
Response: 1 (upwards) or 2 (downwards)
Confidence: Reported on visual analogue scales with poles ("unsure" and "sure"), values between -1(=unsure) and 1 (=sure)
RT_decConf: Response time for both decision and confidence report (given simultaneously)
Coherence (manipulation): Proportion of dots of the random dot stimulus moving in the target direction
Training: Column indicating whether the trial was from the training block


Additional information: 
Sessions and Block size: Subjects completed 1 to 3 sessions, each with one training and 8 experimental blocks. Each block contained 80 trials. (Some subjects completed more trials in a single session due to technical issues)
Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was given as Error-Feedback (showing the word "Error" vor 1sec only after incorrect trials).
Response device: Joystick (Cyborg V1)
Experimental setting: Lab, darkened room
Instructions: Participants were asked to respond as accurately as possible (including their confidence) without time pressure.
Location: Data were collected at the Lab of the General Psychology II department of the KU Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt.
