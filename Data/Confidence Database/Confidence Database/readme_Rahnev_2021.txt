Neuroscience of Consciousness, 2021(1), niab039.* Task: Perception task; Subjects judged whether briefly presented Gabor gratings were drawn from one of two overlapping orientation distributions (low- vs. high-variability conditions) and then rated their confidence on a 4-point scale* Condition: Condition 1, Low-variability condition: The two distributions had means of –2.4° (counterclockwise) and +2.4° (clockwise) with a standard deviation of 6°. Condition 2, High-variability condition: The same distributions were scaled up threefold, with means of –7.2° and +7.2° and a standard deviation of 18°.* Block size: 50 trials per block, 8 blocks for each condition* Stimulus: 0 (stimulus drawn from the counterclockwise distribution), 1(stimulus drawn from the clockwise distribution)* Response: 0 (reported the counterclockwise distribution), or 1 (reported the clockwise distribution)* Accuracy: 0 (decision is not correct), or 1 (decision is correct)* RT_dec: response time in s for the perceptual decision* Confidence:  Confidence was reported in a 4-point scale. * RT_conf: response time in s for the confidence* stimAngle: the visual orientation angle of the Gabor grating displayed on a given trial* Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was provided.
