* Contributor(s): Yunxuan Zheng (yzheng447@gatech.edu), Kai Xue, Medha Shekhar & Dobromir Rahnev* Citation: A common computational principle for decision-making with confidence, expectation and rewad* Task: subjects need to decide which side (left or right) of black square (in 15 x 15 grid) contained more white dots* Condition: 0 (need to report confidence after decision), 1 (receive expectation cue before stimuli, no confidence report), 2 (receive expectation cue after stimuli, no confidence report), 3 (receive reward cue before stimuli, no confidence report), 4 (receive reward cue after stimuli, no confidence report)* Cued_side: -10 (no cue presented, for confidence condition), 0 (cue favored the square in the left side), 1 (cue favored the square in the right side)* Cue_value: -10 (no cue presented), 1 (both side of squares are equally likely to be correct in expectation condition, or equally rewarding in reward condition), 3 (one side of square is 3 times more likely to be correct in expectation condition, or leads to 3 points in reward condition)* Block size: 100 trials for confidence condition (condition 0), 150 trials for the other four conditions* Stimulus: 0 (left side of square contains more dots),  1(right side of square contains more dots)* Accuracy: 0 (decision is not correct), or 1 (decision is correct)* Confidence:  Confidence was reported in a binary scale.  1 (50%-75% confidence), or 2 (75%-100% confidence). Except for the confidence condition, subjects were not required to report confidence in the four cue conditions. Therefore, the confidence rating was recorded as -1 in those conditions.* RT_dec: response time in ms for the perceptual decision* RT_conf: response time in ms for the confidence (-1 when no confidence reported)* Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was not provided.
